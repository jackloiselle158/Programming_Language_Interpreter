# Programming_Language_Interpreter
An interpreter for a simple programming language built in C


This is a project I completed as my final project for my System Programming class at Indiana University - Bloomington (CSCI-C291). It is an interpreter for a simple programming language created by my professor.

The name of the language is called Pip. It's supposed to look like a mix of bash and C. You can make variables (integers and booleans), functions, if / if-else statements, and while loops. Each program needs a main function that is run when the file is interpreted. The majority of the code was written by my instructor. The functions to evaluate expressions, statements, functions, and blocks (can be found in Eval.c) were written and implemented by me.
